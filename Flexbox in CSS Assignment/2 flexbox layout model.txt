Q2. Explain the role of the following key properties in the Flexbox layout model
1. justify-content
2. align-items
3. gap
4. flex-direction
5. flex-wrap

Ans. 
1. Justify-content: The justify-content property aligns the flexible container's items when the items do not use all available space on the main-axis (horizontally).

-> Use the align-items property to align the items vertically.

Note: The justify-content property can also be used on a grid container to align grid items in the inline direction. For pages in English, inline direction is left to right and block direction is downward.

2. Align-items: The align-items property specifies the default alignment for items inside a flexbox or grid container.

-> In a flexbox container, the flexbox items are aligned on the cross axis, which is vertical by default (opposite of flex-direction).

-> In a grid container, the grid items are aligned in the block direction. For pages in English, block direction is downward and inline direction is left to right.

->For this property to have any alignment effect, the items need available space around themselves in the appropriate direction.

-> Use the align-self property of each item to override the align-items property.

3. Gap: The gap property defines the size of the gap between the rows and between the columns in flexbox, grid or multi-column layout. It is a shorthand for the following properties:

-> row-gap
-> column-gap
Note: The gap property was formerly known as grid-gap.

4. Flex-direction: The flex-direction property specifies the direction of the flexible items.

Note: If the element is not a flexible item, the flex-direction property has no effect.

5. Flex-wrap: The flex-wrap property specifies whether the flexible items should wrap or not.

Note: If the elements are not flexible items, the flex-wrap property has no effect.
